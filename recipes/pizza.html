    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This pizza dough recipe was given to me by a friend. It's quick and easy to make for a delicious homemade pizza crust that you
        can top with pizza sauce and your favorite toppings!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>2 cups bread flour, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Stir yeast, sugar, and warm water together in a small bowl. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir 2 cups of bread flour and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add yeast mixture and 2 tablespoons of olive oil;
            beat with dough hook on medium speed until dough is soft and slightly tacky, about 8 minutes, adding up to 3 tablespoons more
            flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing after each addition.</li>
        <li>Cover and let rise at room temperature until doubled in volume, at least 1 hour or up to 2 hours. (Alternatively, cover and
            let rise in the refrigerator overnight.)</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C) with oven rack positioned in lower third. Turn dough out onto a lightly
            floured work surface. Shape into a round and roll into a thin crust. Place on a large parchment-lined baking sheet or pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Top with desired pizza sauce and toppings. Brush edges with remaining 1 tablespoon oil.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until crust is golden and cheese is melted bubbly, about 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
