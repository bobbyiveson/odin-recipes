    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        On my first trip to Italy in 1995 to meet my husband's family, I didn't speak a word of Italian. But I did learn how to make
        great dolci (desserts) from his sister, Maria. This is her authentic tiramisu recipe, and now they ask me to make it whenever
        we go back!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups brewed espresso, cooled, divided</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, separated, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brandy</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages mascarpone cheese</li>
        <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
        <li>30 ladyfingers (such as Savoiardi)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat 1 tablespoon espresso, ½ cup sugar, egg yolks, and brandy together in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth, 2 to 3
            minutes. Beat in mascarpone cheese until well blended, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Beat egg whites and 1 pinch sugar in a separate bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form; gently fold into
            mascarpone mixture. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Pour remaining espresso into a shallow dish. Dip 1 side of each ladyfinger into espresso; arrange on a serving platter in two
            horizontal rows of 6 ladyfingers, plus 1 ½ ladyfingers in opposite directions on both ends to form a rectangular shape.</li>
        <li>Spread ½ mascarpone mixture onto ladyfingers; dust with ½ cocoa powder. Top with remaining ½ each ladyfingers dipped in
            espresso, mascarpone mixture, and cocoa powder.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate tiramisu until ladyfingers have softened, 2 to 3 hours.</li>
    </ol>
