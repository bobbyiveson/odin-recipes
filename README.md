# odin-recipes

This is a recipes website that contains a main index page with links to multiple recipes.

This project currently contains just html & is a chance for me to practice my html skills.

The website contains a main index.html site with a list of links to my favourite Italian
recipes.

I've included links to 3 seperate recipe pages for:
- Pizza
- Lasagna
- Tiramisu

Yep! I love my Italian food :D

In this project I've showcased how to create boilerplate html code containing:
- title
- lang attribute in the html tag
- meta tags for page encoding & viewport
- paragraph & heading elements
- anchor elements to link to other pages on the site
- unordered & ordered lists to show lists of information such as ingredients & steps to
complete the recipes
- image elements to show the user an image of what the recipe end product might look like
- including a home page link to let the user go back to the list of recipes & check out
the other recipes
